My name is Guy Zwerdling. Iâ€™m a living in Israel, and really love to laugh, cartoons and animations, books, beer, Rock&Roll, guitars, and travel in little land called Israel. I also spend a fair amount of time cracking and build things together in Python, JavaScript and React-Native - not so long ago I finished developing my first application based on my dear brother's book.

I build this site to help other to learn and developed and do stuff, I think that it doesn't matter who you are, it's doesn't matter where you come from, it's doesn't matter who they think you are, all that matter is **what do you think about yourself**, if you have some dream go and fulfill it!

I hope that my work here will inspire other for they will do what they love no matter what and never give up, I sure that if you push hard enough and keep doing it, eventually you will be successful.

With great power comes great responsibility. The power is inside you!

Please note that I'm not responsible for every knowledge you've got here! please stay legal, stay ethical!! for me the greatest guys in that filed are the white hat hackers that helps to make a better security and improved everything in the technological world.

Now I am searching for the next challenge!

Hello every one, this is my first blog at my first website, so, congratulations to myself!


I think that because this is my first website that I develop by myself there is no beter place to tells my story.

At the beginning I start my creer as Network technician at Israel Air Force, after three years I left the army and I find a job in Israel Ministry Of Healf, I worked there four years as Network and Security engineer, in that job I was rensposible on wide range of network devices like Cisco and HP and as a security guy I I was manage CyberArk vault and ODIX Safe.

I also helped to my team operating another security appliance like CheckPoint FW and wise-moon NAC and for one moment I found myself fascinated about the Security filed I was able to play with security component like PaloAlto FW, IBM DataPower, F5 BIG-IP and WAF, proxies servers and etc. and as the time passed I found myself with grater will to be an EXPERT in CyberSecurity area.

So I start to learn about some attacks like XSS ,SQL injection, CSRF etc. I also start to lern python and challenge myself with challenge website coding python.


It was so fun, I leaned and play with everything product that I was able to put my hands on! but after while I can't able to see my future in that place because of the bureaucracy in the Information Department that made some changes in our team so I decided to leave and after long search I found some place that was look like a fit place for my, so I applied for a job in BrightSource.


Over there I got responsibilities on cisco devices and security stuff and I exposed to mor coolest proxies like Websense and fireglass I also manage MDM named Intune by mycrosoft and at the first time I found myself writing scripts in PowerShell to solved some weird issue in that MDM product the live was so fun, but unfortunately I fired after a half year, and in my family the thing was get worse and we passed some difficult situation that I don't want to write about here.


However, as I said, this is my first site ever, so I glod and want to thaks to God that bring me here to do great stuff, I want to thank my parents that support me all the way.

I also want to thank my mentor Sagi Kedmi that learnd me and keep learning me every week some seriesly stuff in cybersecurity and programing, and also I wanna thank to Max that keep pushing me and motivate me to learn.

And also many thanks to my beautiful girlfriend that keep feedback me about this site!

This is all for now, wish u the best!

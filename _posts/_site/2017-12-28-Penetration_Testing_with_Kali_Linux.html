<p>To be a Cyber Researcher we need in my opinion to have a very good knowledge about everything that related to  hacking world. There is a lot technologies out there that are very important in our security world and the way they work is very unique and special, yes, you must have a knowledge about programming if you want to be professional Cyber Reasercher , but for pentesting all we need is maybe script languages, any way we need to have a very good and basic understanding in the security world which is include Linux, Networking, script programming language like Python or JavaScript etc. In this article we will go through all of those stuff but before that I want to specified what CheckPoint think that is the basic knowledge that we must have to be a very good ethical hacker:</p>

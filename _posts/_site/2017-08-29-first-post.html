<p>Hello every one, this is my first blog at my first website, so, congratulations to myself!</p>

<p>I think that because this is my first website that I develop by myself there is no beter place to tells my story.</p>

<p>At the beginning I start my creer as Network technician at Israel Air Force, after three years I left the army and I find a job in Israel Ministry Of Healf, I worked there four years as Network and Security engineer, in that job I was rensposible on wide range of network devices like Cisco and HP and as a security guy I I was manage CyberArk vault and ODIX Safe.</p>

<p>I also helped to my team operating another security appliance like CheckPoint FW and wise-moon NAC and for one moment I found myself fascinated about the Security filed I was able to play with security component like PaloAlto FW, IBM DataPower, F5 BIG-IP and WAF, proxies servers and etc. and as the time passed I found myself with grater will to be an EXPERT in CyberSecurity area.</p>

<p>So I start to learn about some attacks like XSS ,SQL injection, CSRF etc. I also start to lern python and challenge myself with challenge website coding python.</p>

<p>It was so fun, I leaned and play with everything product that I was able to put my hands on! but after while I can’t able to see my future in that place because of the bureaucracy in the Information Department that made some changes in our team so I decided to leave and after long search I found some place that was look like a fit place for my, so I applied for a job in BrightSource.</p>

<p>Over there I got responsibilities on cisco devices and security stuff and I exposed to mor coolest proxies like Websense and fireglass I also manage MDM named Intune by mycrosoft and at the first time I found myself writing scripts in PowerShell to solved some weird issue in that MDM product the live was so fun, but unfortunately I fired after a half year, and in my family the thing was get worse and we passed some difficult situation that I don’t want to write about here.</p>

<p>However, as I said, this is my first site ever, so I glod and want to thaks to God that bring me here to do great stuff, I want to thank my parents that support me all the way.</p>
